            <br><br>
            <p>Have you ever experienced the frustration of finding your favourite product out of stock just when you're ready to make a purchase? Well, it's not just a letdown for you but also a significant loss for the retailers. In 2018, retailers lost out on $300 million in revenue due to poor inventory management, and that was before the pandemic. Pre-pandemic, the odds of shoppers seeing an out-of-stock message were 1 in 200. That figure rose to 1 in 59 in 2022, a 235% increase (<a href="https://www.retailbrew.com/stories/2023/04/25/why-inventory-management-is-important-for-retailers" target="_blank">source</a>). In a survey, almost half of respondents (46%) indicated that overbuying inventory and buying the wrong type of products are top contributing factors to markdowns(<a href="https://www.mytotalretail.com/article/hidden-costs-of-poor-inventory-management/" target="_blank">source</a>).</p>
            <br>
            <img src="images/inventrory_intro_quote.jpg" class= "intro-quote">
            <br>
            <p>This results in dissatisfied customers, decreased profits, high holding costs, expired inventory, and inevitable write-offs. But, who bears the responsibility for this inventory mismanagement? Products don't magically appear on shelves, right? They go through a complex distribution process involving multiple middlemen. In a typical One Level Channel distribution, the retailer stands between the manufacturer and the customer, serving as the crucial link responsible for managing inventory to meet customer demand and maximize profit.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="images/inventrory_one_level_distribution.png" class= "intro-quote">
            <br>
            <p>Yet, managing inventory is far from simple. It presents countless challenges, including poor demand forecasting, the impact of seasonality and trends, delays in purchasing, limitations in production capacity, delayed fulfilment, and more. Therefore, every retailer must implement a <span>framework to optimize inventory management by identifying the ideal time for purchases</span> to minimize overstocking or stockouts while maximizing revenue. The framework must be capable of answering the following questions:</p>
            <br>
            <ol style="padding-left: 80px;">
                <li>What product categories are in the highest demand?</li>
                <li>Which factors influence demand?</li>
                <li>What quantities of fast, slow and non-moving products are available in the inventory?</li>
                <li>What quantities of high and low profitable products are available in the inventory?</li>
                <li>What is the store’s average inventory replacement rate (or Inventory turnover rate), and how does it vary across product categories?</li>
                <li>Which vendors are reliable and have shorter fulfilment times?</li>
                <li>What is the fulfilment capacity of vendors?</li>
                <li>What are the associated purchase costs for each order?</li>
                <li>How level of demand can be expected in the upcoming days?</li>
                <li>Are there any emerging trends or consumer preferences that may impact future demand patterns?</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>Very few companies have achieved excellence in optimizing their inventory. For instance, Companies like Amazon, Walmart, and Coca-Cola have successfully implemented predictive analytics in their inventory management systems, resulting in significant cost savings and improved operational efficiency. Particularly, Amazon uses predictive analytics to manage its vast inventory effectively. By analyzing customer buying behaviour, Amazon can predict product demand with a high degree of accuracy and adjust its inventory levels accordingly. This has helped Amazon reduce its inventory holding costs and improve customer satisfaction (<a href="https://www.brisklogic.co/the-predictive-analytics-in-inventory-management/" target="_blank">source</a>).</p>
            <br><p>In summary, effective inventory management is essential for retailers to remain competitive in today's dynamic marketplace. By embracing technological advancements and implementing robust inventory optimization strategies, retailers can minimize stock-related challenges, maximize profitability, and deliver superior value to customers.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>This project requires a thorough level of data encompassing sales, product, inventory, and purchase details. Accordingly, the data was collected from 2 major sources:</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Source 1: PWC’s Inventory Analysis Case Study Data files</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>PWC offers a combination of 6 datasets covering end-to-end product distribution operations of Bibitor LLC, a liquor store chain in the fictional state of Lincoln. It is a major retailer with approximately 80 locations and total sales more than $450 million within a single year. <b>These datasets cover all transactions occurring between the retailer (Bibitor), vendors and customers throughout the year 2016.</b></p>
            <br>

                <li>2.  Purchases <i>(PurchasesFINAL12312016.csv):</i>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Description: Provides the complete purchase history of products by the retailer from various vendors, including fulfilment details.</li>

            <h3>Source 2: OpenAI API</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>Data obtained from Source 1 primarily centres on transactions but lacks essential product details. The Bibitor dataset comprises over 11,000 Liquor SKUs, yet only provides descriptions without further particulars. Understanding the drivers of product demand necessitates comprehensive product details. Therefore, the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api" target="_blank">OpenAI API</a> was used to gather the following information for each product:</p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Alcohol Type:</b> The category of alcohol, including options such as Wine, Vodka, Whiskey, Rum, Tequila, and more.</li>
                <li><b>Alcohol By Volume (ABV):</b> The percentage of alcohol content in the beverage, typically ranging from 0% to 100%.</li>
                <li><b>Flavor Profile:</b> The sensory characteristics of the drink, encompassing flavor such as Herbal, Sweet, Spicy, Floral, Sour, and others.</li>

            <h4>Data Preparation Steps:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Standardized “Size” column:</i>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Initially, the size column contained disparate units and noisy data. To rectify this, it was transformed into a uniform millimeter unit, following the removal of irrelevant noise.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/inventory_DataPrep_1.jpg" class= "DataPrep-Step">
                </li>

                <li>2. Data extraction from OpenAI dataset:</i>
                    <ul>
                        <li>OpenAI responses were noisy with extraneous information. Hence, only the relevant information was extracted.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/inventory_DataPrep_2.jpg" class= "DataPrep-Step">
                </li>

                <li>3. Generated unique product ID:</i>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the absence of a designated ID for product SKUs in the raw dataset, the entire product information had to be replicated across all tables containing product data. To streamline this, SKU details from all raw tables were combined, and distinct IDs were created for each product SKU.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>6. Fixed data types</i>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All numeric ID columns were converted to object types.</li>

            <h1 class="sub-title">Clustering</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>Clustering is as an unsupervised learning method in machine learning, dividing data based on feature distances. Its goal is to group similar records within clusters (cohesion) while maintaining dissimilarity from objects in other clusters (separation). There are multiple ways to implement clustering however the most popular implementation includes K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>K-Means Clustering: </b>This partitioning technique clusters data into a set number of clusters by aggregating the K closest points to a designated point. Various distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.) can be utilized based on the context.</b></p>
            <img src="images/clustering_kmeans.png" class= "DataPrep-Step" style="max-width: 65%;">
            <br>
            <p><b>Hierarchical Clustering: </b>This method organizes data hierarchically, constructing dendrogram tree structures. Agglomerative clustering starts with the assumption that each point forms its own cluster, gradually merging them until ideally only one cluster remains. Similar to K-Means, diverse distance metrics and linkage methods are available, chosen according to the specific case.</b></p>
            <img src="images/clustering_hier.png" class= "DataPrep-Step" style="max-width: 30%;">
            <br>
            <p>For this application, both clustering and hierarchical clustering are applied in this scenario to categorize liquor items based on demand and profitability. This will aid in stock planning to maximize profit.</b></p>
            <br>
            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>Liquor information, its sales history and net profit data is required to implement and infer the clustering results. Hence, data clustering data was prepared by:</b></p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Left joining Product_Info with Product_Purchase_Sale_Price tables and taking purchase and sales price from the right table to calculate profit_per_product.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Right joining the resultant data with SalesHistory table to calculate demand per day.</li>

            <h3>Inference & Conclusion</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Both K-Means and Hierarchical clustering have effectively organized the data, displaying a similar distribution across clusters with minimal discrepancies. Notably, cluster number 2 exhibits the highest number of records in both methods. After careful evaluation, the <b>4-cluster partition is chosen as the final clustering solution for this analysis.</b> While the 3-cluster split captures a larger proportion of points in the Low Profit Low demand cluster, 5 clusters divides the data into unnecessary chunks. In contrast, the 4-cluster split aligns better with the objective. Summary of each clusters are presented below:</p>
            <br>
            <p>The clusters represent the following:</p>
            <br><img src="images/clustering_cluster_summary.PNG" class= "DataPrep-Step" style="max-width: 50%;">
            <br>
            <h4>Cluster 1: Cash Cow- High Demand Low Profit</h4>
            <p>These are cash cow products that are very frequently purchased that yield lowest profit per product but yields the highest profit overall. These products generate consistent cash flow and are often considered as the main revenue drivers for a company. These products must have the highest inventory share.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Cluster 0: Commodity- Low Demand Moderate Profit</h4>
            <p>These are commodity products that are typically bought less but have moderate profit leading to a decent overall profit. These products must have moderate inventory share.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Cluster 3: Luxury- Low Demand High Profit</h4>
            <p>These are premium products that are rarely purchased but yields the highest profit. These products must have the lowest inventory share.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Cluster 2: Laggards- Low Demand Low Profit</h4>
            <p>These products are laggards that have reasonable demand but low profits. These products usually take up the inventory space and results in low overall profit. These products must have low inventory share.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The above four clusters are well interpretable, and the cluster numbers are renamed with its appropriate names and are added as a feature “ProductDemandCluster” in the product info table.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>Association Rule Mining (ARM) is an unsupervised machine learning method used to discover patterns and association in a transaction data. The goal is to typically identify relationships between the itemset in the format <b>{Antecedent}</b> -> <b>{Consequent}</b>. ARM is computed using three key measures:</p>
            <br><img src="images/ARM_intro_1.png" class= "DataPrep-Step" style="max-width: 70%;">
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Support:
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is the frequency of an item/ itemset occurred in the entire sale. It is more like the prior probability. o	Low support signifies that the product is not purchased by sufficient # people to apply association rules.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Confidence:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Defines the level of confidence that Consequents will be bought when Antecedent is bought already. It is more like a conditional probability. o	Low confidence signifies that consequent is independent of antecedent and no association exist between them.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Lift:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Defines how much the probability of buying consequent is lifted when purchased along with antecedent rather just buying them independently. Always, Confidence > Support (Lift > 1) is ideal as it signifies that buying Antecedent lifts the purchase of Consequent. It is conditional probability divided by prior probability.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ol>

            <p>Apriori stands as a widely utilized association rule mining (ARM) technique rooted in the fundamental principle: "If an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent." Leveraging this property, ARM efficiently prunes item sets with low support, thereby minimizing the search space. In this project, we're using the Apriori algorithm to find connections between liquor products based on their Alcohol Type and Flavor. <b>The goal is to figure out which combinations of Alcohol Type and Flavor are frequently bought together, giving us insights into customer preferences.</b></p>
            <br>
            <h3>Data Preparation</h3><br>
            <p>Unlike other machine learning algorithms, ARM is used with unlabelled transactional data. Therefore, from the Sales_History dataset, only variables related to alcohol type and flavor profile are extracted.</p>

            <h3>Experiment Setup & Results</h3><br>
            <p>Apriori algorithm was used to extract rules from the dataset for the below combinations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style-type: circle">Minimum Support: 5%</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: circle">Confidence: 10%</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The item sets with top 10 support, confidence and lift are displayed below along with it's network representation.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3><br>
            <p>The findings indicate that Fruity flavor and Wine alcohol type are the top sellers individually, showing high support. Specifically, the combination of Fruity flavor with Wine is the most commonly purchased, displaying high confidence and lift. However, no significant relationships are observed among other combinations. This suggests that, in general, <b>people do not exhibit strong preferences for specific Alcohol Types and Flavors beyond Fruity flavor with Wine.</b></p>
